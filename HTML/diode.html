             1.A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction <br>
             2.It has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.<br>
             3.A diode thermionic diode is a vacuum tube with two electrodes.<br>
             4.A semiconductor diode, the most commonly used type today.<br>
             5.Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices.<br>
             6.Diodes are all considered passive devices.<br>
